metaCoin, petShop are original example from Truffle suite.

payroll is an example desiged by Tao to practise and understand solidity syntax.

MarksWill* is example from LSU Blockchain course using solidity, truffle and webpack as frontend.
NOTE: Avoid using MarksWill_webpack, which is deprecated! Use react package for front-end design

eventTest is an simple example to test how to interact with EVENTS.

ipfsLab is an example to try using IPFS. For details, visit their website which has a video tutorial.

quickTest is an setted-up environment to quickly try out something fun.

NOTE: the design with frontend is using React env, (bcai_v2.0 as an example) which is different from typical truffle env. Use caution to put files in the right place.
